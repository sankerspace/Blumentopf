Controller should work on a Particle Photon, but also can run an Arduino
Here you can find a description how to prepare/compile to run the Controller.ino
on a Particle Photon

Configuration on the breadboard:
-Particle Photon
-DS3231 Real Time Controller
-nRF24L01+ 

Pin Configuration:
  rf-Gnd/Pin1 to ground-breadboard
  rf-Vcc/Pin2 to  3,3v-breadboard
  rf-CE/Pin3 to   D6-photon
  rf-CS/Pin4 to   A2-photon
  rf-SCK/Pin5 to  A3-photon
  rf-MOSI/Pin6 to A5-photon
  rf-MISO/Pin7 to A4-photon

  DS3231/VCC  to   3,3v-breadboard
  DS3231/Gnd  to   Ground-breadboard
  DS3231/SCL  to   D0-photon  
  DS3231/SDA  to   D1-photon
  
  
1)  Prepare Atom IDE (half online/ half offline)

  https://atom.io/packages/particle-dev
 
2) Create Symbolic Links to all cpp and h files necessary for controller.ino
    
    Start bash script <path-to_repo>/Doku/Particle/createSymbols.sh
    which automatically creates alls symbol links to these files 
    inside folder  <path-to_repo>/Controller 
 
3)  Compile Controller.ino for Photon
